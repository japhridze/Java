# Books Catalog

The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to use `Map` collections.

Duration: **1 hour 30 minutes**

## Description

In this task, you will simulate work with a book catalog. The catalog can be represented as the `TreeMap` collection, where the author is the key and the list of published books is the value. You have the following description:

* The `Author` class, which consists of the first and last name
* The `Book` class, which consists of the title, genre, and cost

Since the book catalog is an ordered map, the `Author` and `Book` classes must implement the `Comparable` interface.
The `BooksCatalog` class must have two constructors: a default one and one with a parameter that creates a map based on an existing map.

Please proceed to the  `Author` and `Book` classes and provide implementations of the `compareTo()` method.

Please, proceed to the `BooksCatalog` class and provide implementations of the following methods:
* `List<Book> findByAuthor(Author author)` \
  Returns a list of books by the specified author or `null` if there is no such author in the catalog
* `List<Author> findAuthorsByBook(Book book)` \
  Returns a list of the authors of the specified book or `null` if there is no such book in the catalog
* `String getAllAuthors()` \
  Returns a list of all the authors as a String
* `Set<Book> findBooksByGenre(String pattern)` \
  Returns a set of books of the specified genre or `null` if there are no books of this genre
* `Map<Book, List<Author>> findAuthorsByBookTitle(String pattern)` \
  Returns the book/author pair map. The search is carried out based on   the words in the book's title

### Details

* To order the map by author, apply alphabetical order by first name and, if the names match, alphabetical order by last name.
* To order the map by book title, apply alphabetical order by title and, if the titles match, by ascending cost.
* The `findAuthorsByBookTitle` method searches for books based on a word pattern; it is case-insensitive.
* The `findBooksByGenre` method searches for books of a certain genre specified as a search pattern; the matching pattern and name of the genre are case-insensitive; all the books found are sorted using natural ordering.
* You can use a regular expression to match occurrences of a pattern in a book title or genre in the `findBooksByGenre` and `findAuthorsByBookTitle` methods.
* The `getAllAuthors` method returns an alphabetical list of authors as a String, where the authors' names are separated by '\n'.
* No methods of the `BooksCatalog` class accept `null`, and they must throw a `NullPointerException` if they do.
* You can use the `getData()` method in the Util class to create the initial map.
* You can add any private methods to the `BooksCatalog` class.


## Restrictions

You may not use lambdas or streams when implementing this task.
