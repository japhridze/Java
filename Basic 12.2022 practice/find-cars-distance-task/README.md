# Linear calculations

The purpose of this exercise is to check if you understand data types and operations with variables.

Duration: **15** minutes

## Description

Proceed to `LinearCalculation` class and implement two methods:
- `public static double findCarsDistance(double car1Speed, double car2Speed, double initialDistance, double time)` \
  The speed of the first car is V1 km/h, the speed of 
  the second car is V2 km/h, the distance between them is S km. 
  Find the distance between cars after T hours, if the cars are 
  distancing from each other. The given distance is equal the sum 
  of the initial distance + the general way, which was covered 
  by cars; the general way = time * total speed. \
  The method returns the distance.
 
#### Example:
```
V1 = 90 km/h; V2 = 110 km/h; S = 65 km; T = 3 h  =>  Distance = 665 km
V1 = 65.5 km/h; V2 = 90.4 km/h; S = 20.9 km; T = 1.5 h  =>  Distance = 254.75 km
V1 = 70 km/h; V2 = 85.6 km/h; S = 32.6 km; T = 2 h  =>  Distance = 343.8 km
```
