# Distance between maximum value

The purpose of this exercise is to train you to work with arrays.

Estimated workload of this exercise is *20 min*.

### Description

Please, proceed to [IntArrayUtil](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/array/IntArrayUtil.java) class
and implement its static method:

`int maximumDistance(int[] array)`

* In a given array of integers nums calculate integer result value, that is equal to the distance between the first and the last entry of the maximum value in the array.

* Note that input array may be empty.

## Examples

Input:

```
{4, 100, 3, 4}
{5, 50, 50, 4, 5}
{5, 350, 350, 4, 350}
{10, 10, 10, 10, 10}
```

Output:

```
result = 0
result = 1
result = 3
result = 4 
```
