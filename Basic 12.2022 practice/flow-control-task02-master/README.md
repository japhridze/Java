# Sum of binary 1

The purpose of this exercise is to train you to work with loop statements.

Estimated workload of this exercise is _30 min_.

### Description
Please, proceed to [`LoopStatements`](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/LoopStatements.java) class
and implement its static methods:
---
* `int sumOfBinary(int n)`\
  For a positive integer n calculate the result value, which is equal to the amount of the “1” in the binary
  representation of n.
  
###  Example:  
`n = 14 ( 1110 )`   -> result =  3   
`n = 128 ( 1000 0000 )`  ->  result =  1  

---

### Examples

---
Code Sample:
```java
...
System.out.println(LoopStatements.sumOfBinary(14));
System.out.println(LoopStatements.sumOfBinary(128));
```

Output:
```
3
1
```
