# Find the maximum integer

The purpose of this exercise is to train you to work with condition statements.

Estimated workload of this exercise is _30 min_.

### Description
Please, proceed to [`ConditionStatements`](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/ConditionStatements.java) class
and implement its static method:

---
* `int task2(int n)`\
Find the maximum integer, that can be obtained by permutation of numbers of an arbitrary three-digit positive integer n `(100<=n<=999)`.
###  Example:
`n = 165`  -> result =  651

`n = 123` -> result = 321

---
### Examples

---
Code Sample:
```java
...
System.out.println(ConditionStatements.task2(165));
System.out.println(ConditionStatements.task2(123));
```

Output:
```
651
321
```
